# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Android To-Do List application built with Flutter and Firebase. The app will provide users with a full-featured task management system including authentication, real-time synchronization, collaboration features, and enhanced user experience elements. The application will support offline functionality and provide seamless cross-device synchronization through Firebase Cloud Firestore.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and securely log into the app, so that my tasks are private and synchronized across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display registration and login options
2. WHEN a user provides valid email and password for registration THEN the system SHALL create a new Firebase Auth account
3. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them via Firebase Auth
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email via Firebase Auth
5. IF Google login is implemented THEN the system SHALL authenticate users via Google OAuth
6. IF Facebook login is implemented THEN the system SHALL authenticate users via Facebook OAuth
7. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
8. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL persist their login state across app sessions

### Requirement 2: Task Management (CRUD Operations)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete tasks with detailed information, so that I can effectively manage my to-do items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL store title, description, due date, priority level, and category in Firestore
2. WHEN a user views their tasks THEN the system SHALL display all task information in an organized list
3. WHEN a user edits an existing task THEN the system SHALL update the task data in Firestore
4. WHEN a user marks a task as completed THEN the system SHALL update the task status and timestamp
5. WHEN a user marks a completed task as uncompleted THEN the system SHALL revert the task status
6. WHEN a user deletes a task THEN the system SHALL remove it from Firestore after confirmation
7. WHEN task operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before saving
8. WHEN tasks are modified THEN the system SHALL update the last modified timestamp

### Requirement 3: Task Organization and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize and filter my tasks in multiple ways, so that I can quickly find and prioritize what needs to be done.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses sort options THEN the system SHALL provide sorting by due date, priority, and creation time
2. WHEN a user applies a sort THEN the system SHALL reorder tasks according to the selected criteria
3. WHEN a user filters tasks THEN the system SHALL show options for completed vs pending tasks
4. WHEN a user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL display only tasks from that category
5. WHEN a user searches for tasks THEN the system SHALL filter results based on title and description keywords
6. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text
7. WHEN no tasks match filters THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
8. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL restore the full task list

### Requirement 4: Real-time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to automatically sync across devices and work offline, so that I can access my tasks anywhere and never lose data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies a task THEN the system SHALL automatically sync changes to Firestore
2. WHEN the device is online THEN the system SHALL receive real-time updates from Firestore
3. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL store changes locally for later sync
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync pending changes
5. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve using last-write-wins strategy
6. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL display all previously synced tasks
7. WHEN sync is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
8. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and show error states if persistent

### Requirement 5: Notifications and Reminders

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive timely notifications about my tasks, so that I don't miss important deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task has a due date THEN the system SHALL schedule a notification before the deadline
2. WHEN the notification time arrives THEN the system SHALL display a push notification with task details
3. WHEN a user enables daily reminders THEN the system SHALL send daily notifications for pending tasks
4. WHEN a user taps a notification THEN the system SHALL open the app to the relevant task
5. WHEN a user disables notifications THEN the system SHALL respect their preference
6. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL cancel associated notifications
7. WHEN the app is in background THEN the system SHALL still deliver scheduled notifications
8. WHEN notification permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the limitation

### Requirement 6: Collaboration Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share task lists with others and see real-time updates, so that I can collaborate effectively on shared projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares a task list THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable link or invitation
2. WHEN another user accepts an invitation THEN the system SHALL grant them access to the shared list
3. WHEN collaborators modify shared tasks THEN the system SHALL update all participants in real-time
4. WHEN viewing shared lists THEN the system SHALL display who made recent changes
5. WHEN a user leaves a shared list THEN the system SHALL remove their access
6. WHEN the list owner removes a collaborator THEN the system SHALL revoke their access
7. WHEN collaborators are offline THEN the system SHALL sync changes when they reconnect
8. WHEN permission conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 7: Enhanced User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and customizable interface with gesture support, so that I can efficiently interact with my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables dark mode THEN the system SHALL apply dark theme throughout the app
2. WHEN a user swipes right on a task THEN the system SHALL mark it as completed
3. WHEN a user swipes left on a task THEN the system SHALL show delete confirmation
4. WHEN a user long-presses and drags a task THEN the system SHALL allow reordering
5. WHEN tasks are reordered THEN the system SHALL save the new order preference
6. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
7. WHEN users interact with elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
8. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL remember the user's theme preference

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my task data to be secure and private, so that I can trust the app with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use Firebase Auth security rules
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL apply Firestore security rules to protect user data
3. WHEN users access tasks THEN the system SHALL verify they own or have permission to view them
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
5. WHEN users delete their account THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data
6. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in logs
7. WHEN storing data locally THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
8. WHEN users sign out THEN the system SHALL clear local cached data appropriately
